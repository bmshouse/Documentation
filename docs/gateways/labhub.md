## LabHub

[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an excellent resource for interactive development and data analysis using Python, R, and other languages. Jupyter notebooks can contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text which provide an excellent enviornment to use, learn, and teach interactive data analysis.

CU Research Computing (CURC) operates a [JupyterHub server](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) that enables users to run Jupyter notebooks on Amazon Web Services in support of research and education. This is currently a trial service restricted to a limited number of praticipants.

### Switching between Interfaces

JupyterHub can offer a variety of interfaces that may be available to you. The interfaces can be switched between by appending the proper name to the end of your workspace url. For Example, J. Doe logins in and has a base url of `hxxps://labhub.rc.colorado.edu/user/jdoe/XXXX`. The following can replace the XXXX in the url to switch interfaces:  

| XXXX    | Description                    | Example                                           |  
|---------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|  
| lab     | JupyterLab interface (default) | hxxps://labhub.rc.colorado.edu/user/jdoe/lab      |  
| tree    | JupyterNotebook interface      | hxxps://labhub.rc.colorado.edu/user/jdoe/tree     |  
| rstudio | RStudio interface              | hxxps://labhub.rc.colorado.edu/user/jdoe/rstudio  |  
| vscode  | Visual Studio Code interface   | hxxps://labhub.rc.colorado.edu/user/jdoe/vscode   |  

Note: Access to the named interfaces may not be available to all users.
